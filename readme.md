# ES6 and JavaScript Core Concepts

This repository covers modern JavaScript (ES6) features along with some important core concepts of JavaScript. It is designed to help developers understand the fundamentals and improve their coding skills in a clear and practical way.

## ES6 Features
ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced many new features that make JavaScript more powerful and easier to write. Some of the key features include:

- **Let & Const**: Block-scoped variable declarations.
- **Arrow Functions**: Shorter syntax for writing functions.
- **Template Literals**: Easy string interpolation using backticks ``.
- **Destructuring**: Extract values from arrays or objects easily.
- **Default Parameters**: Set default values for function parameters.
- **Spread & Rest Operators**: Simplify array and object manipulation.
- **Modules**: Organize code into reusable files using `import` and `export`.
- **Classes**: Create objects using a cleaner and more structured syntax.
- **Promises**: Handle asynchronous operations effectively.

## JavaScript Core Concepts
Understanding JavaScript core concepts is essential for writing robust and efficient code. This repository also explains:

- **Scope & Hoisting**: How variables and functions are accessible in different parts of the code.
- **Closures**: Functions that remember the scope in which they were created.
- **Event Loop**: How JavaScript handles asynchronous operations.
- **Callbacks & Promises**: Techniques to manage asynchronous tasks.
- **Async/Await**: Simplified syntax for handling Promises.
- **this Keyword**: Understanding context in different situations.
- **Prototype & Inheritance**: Object-oriented features in JavaScript.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that operate on other functions.

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to provide a simple, clear, and practical understanding of modern JavaScript features and core concepts. It's perfect for beginners and intermediate developers who want to strengthen their JavaScript skills.
